    // This class should contain the code for your algorithms. For utility methods 
    // such as this one, i.e. one where there's no stored data, it's just 
    // calculating a result and returning it without saving anything, or using any
    // saved information, it's better practice to make the method static
    //
    // e.g. public static void sayHello(String name)
    // This would print out "Hello, $name", i.e. the name contained in the name
    // variable. 
    // There's no information saved, there's no information used that isn't
    // supplied as a method parameter, so there's no point in making it an 
    // instance method, i.e. a method tied to a specific instance of a class
